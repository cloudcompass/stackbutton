      Stylesheets and Preprocessors
      ==============================

      You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
      using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage
      of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

      By default, stylesheets from your `assets/styles` folder are included
      here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less)
      are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
      a single file.

      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:

          + Change the order of your CSS files
          + Import stylesheets from other directories
          + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus
  -->

  <!--STYLES-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="min/production.min.css">
  <!--STYLES END-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700,400italic">
</head>

<body ng-controller="ApplicationController">
<%- body %>


<!--
    Client-side Templates
    ========================

    HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
    To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
    that you load these templates client-side.

    By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
    client-side JST templates in your `assets/templates` folder, then
    include them here automatically (between TEMPLATES and TEMPLATES END).

    To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
    For example, here are a few things you could do:

        + Import templates from other directories
        + Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
        + Internationalize your client-side templates using a server-side
          stringfile before they're served.

<script type="text/javascript" src="/jst.js"></script>
<!--TEMPLATES END-->


<!--

  Client-side Javascript
  ========================

  You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
  on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
  take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

  By default, files in your `assets/js` folder are included here
  automatically (between SCRIPTS and SCRIPTS END).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
  CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
  and concatenated into a single file.

  To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
  For example, here are a few things you could do:

      + Change the order of your scripts
      + Import scripts from other directories
      + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
